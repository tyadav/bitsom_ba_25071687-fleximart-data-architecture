# NoSQL Analysis — MongoDB Suitability for FlexiMart

## Section A: Limitations of RDBMS (150 words)
Relational databases become cumbersome when the product catalog contains highly heterogeneous items. Modeling products with different attributes (e.g., laptops with CPU/RAM/SSD vs. shoes with size/color) typically forces either very wide tables with many nullable columns or an entity–attribute–value (EAV) pattern. Wide tables waste storage and complicate indexing; EAV complicates queries, validation, and indexing and makes common read patterns less efficient. Frequent schema changes (adding new product types or attributes) require DDL migrations or ad-hoc workarounds, causing deployment complexity and potential downtime. Storing customer reviews as nested, variable-length data in an RDBMS requires separate review tables and additional joins to assemble product + reviews, increasing query complexity and reducing read performance for the common “show product with reviews” use case. Overall, rigid schemas increase development friction and operational overhead for fast-evolving product domains.

## Section B: NoSQL Benefits (150 words)
MongoDB’s document model directly addresses these issues. Each product is stored as a JSON-like document that can contain different fields per document, so products with distinct attributes coexist naturally without schema changes—no ALTER TABLEs or EAV modeling required. Reviews and related nested data can be embedded as arrays of subdocuments inside the product document, enabling atomic reads and simpler queries for the typical “product with its reviews” view and reducing the need for expensive joins. MongoDB also provides rich indexing on fields inside documents and a powerful aggregation pipeline for analytics on nested structures. Horizontal scalability via sharding allows FlexiMart to distribute large catalogs and heavy write/read workloads across multiple nodes, making it easier to scale out performance and capacity as the catalog and traffic grow.

## Section C: Trade-offs (100 words)
Two disadvantages of using MongoDB instead of MySQL: (1) Consistency & relational constraints—while MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, enforcing complex relational constraints (foreign keys, normalized invariants) often requires extra application logic, and distributed consistency models can be more complex to reason about than a single-node RDBMS. (2) Denormalization & maintenance costs—document embedding and deliberate duplication for performance can increase storage and complicate update logic (the same data may need changing in multiple places), and ad-hoc cross-collection joins and analytical queries can be less straightforward or efficient than SQL joins.
